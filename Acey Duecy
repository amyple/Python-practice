For 4 points use your deck of cards object to play Acey Duecy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acey_Deucey_(card_game)) .  

Make it interactive and have the player get two cards, give an amount to wager, and then get the third card and a decision whether they have won or lost.  Don't bother with ties, consider them a loss and you can consider an Ace either high or low, but not both.
